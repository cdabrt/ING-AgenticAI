The Green Deal is the new growth strategy of the Union. It aims to transform the Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050. It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of Union citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The Green Deal aims to decouple economic growth from resource use, and ensure that all regions and Union citizens participate in a socially just transition to a sustainable economic system whereby no person and no place is left behind. It will contribute to the objective of building an economy that works for the people, strengthening the Union’s social market economy, helping to ensure that it is ready for the future and that it delivers stability, jobs, growth and sustainable investment. These goals are especially important considering the socio-economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for a sustainable, inclusive and fair recovery. Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 4 ) makes the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 binding in the Union. Moreover, in its Communication of 20 May 2020 entitled ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing nature back into our lives’, the Commission commits to ensuring that by 2050 all of the world’s ecosystems are restored, resilient and adequately protected. That strategy aims to put Europe’s biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. ( 1 ) OJ C 517, 22.12.2021, p. 51.

The disclosure by certain categories of undertakings of relevant, comparable and reliable sustainability information is a prerequisite for meeting those objectives. The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a number of legislative acts as part of the implementation of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth. Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 5 ) governs how financial market participants and financial advisers are to disclose sustainability information to end investors and asset owners. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 6 ) creates a classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities with the aim of scaling up sustainable investments and combatting greenwashing of financial products that unduly claim to be sustainable. Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 7 ), complemented by Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2020/1816( 8 ), (EU) 2020/1817( 9 ) and (EU) 2020/1818( 10 ), introduces environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) disclosure requirements for benchmark administrators and minimum standards for the construction of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 11 )requires large institutions which have issued securities that are admitted to trading on a regulated market to disclose information on ESG risks from 28 June 2022. The prudential framework for investment firms established by Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 12 )and Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 13 ) contains provisions concerning the introduction of an ESG risk dimension in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (‘SREP’) by competent authorities, and contains ESG risk disclosure requirements for investment firms, applicable from 26 December 2022. On 6 July 2021, the Commission also adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European green bonds, following up on the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth.

(8) Many stakeholders consider the term ‘non-financial’ to be inaccurate, in particular because it implies that the information in question has no financial relevance. Increasingly, however, such information does have financial relevance. Many organisations, initiatives and practitioners in the field of sustainability reporting refer to ‘sustainability information’. It is therefore preferable to use the term ‘sustainability information’ in place of ‘non- financial information’. Directive 2013/34/EU should therefore be amended to take account of that change in terminology. ( 14 ) OJ C 76, 9.3.2020, p. 23. ( 15 ) OJ C 445, 29.10.2021, p. 94.

Savers who want to invest sustainably will have the opportunity to do so, while all citizens would benefit from a stable, sustainable and inclusive economic system. To realise such benefits, the sustainability information disclosed in the annual reports of undertakings first has to reach two primary groups of users. The first group of users consists of investors, including asset managers, who want to better understand the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues pose for their investments and the impacts of those investments on people and the environment. The second group of users consists of civil society actors, including non-governmental organisations and social partners, which wish to better hold undertakings to account for their impacts on people and the environment. Other stakeholders might also make use of sustainability information disclosed in annual reports, in particular to foster comparability across and within market sectors. The business partners of undertakings, including customers, might rely on sustainability information to understand and, where necessary, report on their sustainability risks and impacts throughout their own value chains. Policy makers and environmental agencies can use such information, in particular on an aggregate basis, to monitor environmental and social trends, to contribute to environmental accounts, and to inform public policy. Few individual citizens and consumers directly consult undertakings’ annual reports, but they might use sustainability information indirectly, for example, when considering the advice or opinions of financial advisers or non- governmental organisations.

(11) There has been a very significant increase in demand for corporate sustainability information in recent years, especially on the part of the investment community. That increase in demand is driven by the changing nature of risks to undertakings and growing investor awareness of the financial implications of those risks. That is especially the case for climate-related financial risks. There is also growing awareness of the risks and opportunities for undertakings and for investments resulting from other environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss, and from health and social issues, including child labour and forced labour. The increase in demand for sustainability information is also driven by the growth in investment products that explicitly seek to meet certain sustainability standards or achieve certain sustainability objectives and to ensure coherence with the ambition of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted on 12 December 2015 (the ‘Paris Agreement’), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and Union policies. Part of that increase is the logical consequence of previously adopted Union legislation, notably Regulations (EU) 2019/2088 and (EU) 2020/852. Some of that increase would have happened in any case, due to fast-changing citizen awareness, consumer preferences and market practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the increase in users’ information needs, in particular as it has exposed the vulnerabilities of workers and undertakings’ value chains. Information on environmental impacts is also relevant in the context of mitigating future pandemics, with human disturbance of ecosystems being increasingly linked to the occurrence and spread of diseases.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1918, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "f34bbf19-3972-49e6-97db-c4bfe9145d08", "page_content": "is also relevant in the context of mitigating future pandemics, with human disturbance of ecosystems being increasingly linked to the occurrence and spread of diseases. (12) Undertakings themselves stand to benefit from carrying out high-quality reporting on sustainability matters. The growth in the number of investment products that aim to pursue sustainability objectives means that good sustainability reporting can enhance an undertaking’s access to financial capital. Sustainability reporting can help undertakings to identify and manage their own risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters. It can provide a basis for better dialogue and communication between undertakings and their stakeholders, and can help undertakings to improve their reputation. Moreover, a consistent basis for sustainability reporting in the form of sustainability reporting standards would lead to relevant and sufficient information being provided and thus significantly decrease ad hoc requests for information.

There is significant evidence that many undertakings do not disclose material information on all major sustainability-related topics, including climate-related information such as all GHG emissions, and factors that affect biodiversity. The report also identified the limited comparability and reliability of sustainability information as significant problems.

(14) In the absence of policy action, the gap between users’ information needs and the sustainability information provided by undertakings is expected to grow. That gap has significant negative consequences. Investors are unable to take sufficient account of sustainability-related risks and opportunities in their investment decisions. The aggregation of multiple investment decisions that do not take adequate account of sustainability-related risks has the potential to create systemic risks that threaten financial stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) and international organisations, such as the Financial Stability Board, have drawn attention to those systemic risks, in particular as regards climate. Investors are also less able to channel financial resources to undertakings and economic activities that address and do not exacerbate social and environmental problems, which undermines the objectives of the Green Deal, the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and the Paris Agreement. Non- governmental organisations, social partners, communities affected by undertakings’ activities, and other stakeholders are less able to hold undertakings accountable for their impacts on people and the environment. This creates an accountability deficit and could lead to lower levels of citizen trust in businesses, which in turn could have negative impacts on the efficient functioning of the social market economy. The lack of generally accepted metrics and methods for measuring, valuing, and managing sustainability-related risks is also an obstacle to the efforts of undertakings to ensure that their business models and activities are sustainable.

In view of the growth of users’ needs for sustainability information, additional categories of undertakings should be required to report sustainability information.

Therefore, third-country undertakings which generate a net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the Union and which have a subsidiary undertaking or a branch on the territory of the Union should be subject to Union sustainability reporting requirements. To ensure the proportionality and enforceability of such requirements, the threshold of having a net turnover of more than EUR 40 million should apply to the branches of third-country undertakings, and the thresholds related to being considered a large undertaking or a small or medium-sized undertaking, except micro undertakings, whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should apply to the subsidiary undertakings of third-country undertakings, as such subsidiary undertakings and branches should be responsible for publishing the sustainability report of the third-country undertaking. The sustainability reports published by the subsidiary undertaking or branch of a third-country undertaking should be prepared in accordance with standards to be adopted by 30 June 2024by the Commission through delegated acts. The subsidiary undertaking or branch of a third-country undertaking should also be able to report in accordance with the standards applying to undertakings established in the Union, or in accordance with standards which are deemed equivalent pursuant to an implementing act. In the event that not all the information required under this amending Directive is provided by the third-country undertaking, despite the best efforts of the subsidiary undertaking or branch of that third-country undertaking to obtain the necessary information, that subsidiary undertaking or branch should provide all the information in its possession and issue a statement indicating that the third-country undertaking did not make the rest of the required information available. In order to ensure the quality and reliability of the reporting, the sustainability reports of third-country undertakings should be published accompanied by an assurance opinion expressed by a person or firm authorised to give an opinion on the assurance of sustainability reporting, either under the national law of the third-country undertaking or of a Member State. In the event that such an assurance opinion is not provided, the subsidiary undertaking or branch of the third-country undertaking should issue a statement indicating that the third-country undertaking did not provide the necessary assurance opinion.

(21) Considering the growing relevance of sustainability-related risks and taking into account that small and medium- sized undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union comprise a significant proportion of all undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union, in order to ensure investor protection, it is appropriate to require that also small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro undertakings, whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union disclose information on sustainability matters. The introduction of such a requirement will help to ensure that financial market participants can include smaller undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union in investment portfolios, on the basis that they report the sustainability information that financial market participants need. It will therefore help to protect and enhance the access of smaller undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union to financial capital, and avoid discrimination against such undertakings on the part of financial market participants. The introduction of the requirement for small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro undertakings, whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union to disclose information on sustainability matters is also necessary to ensure that financial market participants have the information they need from investee undertakings to be able to comply with their own sustainability disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Small and medium-sized undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should be given the possibility of reporting in accordance with standards that are proportionate to their capacities and resources, and relevant to the scale and complexity of their activities. Small and medium-sized undertakings whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should also have the possibility of choosing to use such proportionate standards on a voluntary basis. The sustainability reporting standards for small and medium-sized undertakings will constitute a reference for undertakings that are within the scope of the requirements introduced by this amending Directive regarding the level of sustainability information that they could reasonably request from small and medium-sized undertakings that are suppliers or clients in the value chains of such undertakings. Small and medium-sized undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should, in addition, be given sufficient time to prepare for the application of the provisions requiring sustainability reporting, due to their smaller size and more limited resources, and taking account of the difficult economic circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the provisions on corporate sustainability reporting as regards small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro undertakings, whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should apply for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2026. Following that date, for a transitional period of two years, small and medium-sized undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should have the possibility of opting-out from the sustainability reporting requirements laid down in this amending Directive, provided they briefly state in their management report why the sustainability information has not been provided.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 3885, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "4a544de3-2075-44f5-8464-209f7be88153", "page_content": "sustainability reporting requirements laid down in this amending Directive, provided they briefly state in their management report why the sustainability information has not been provided.

It is necessary, however, to ensure that sustainability information is easily accessible for users, and to ensure that there is transparency as regards which parent undertaking of the exempted subsidiary undertaking is reporting at group level. It is therefore necessary to require those subsidiary undertakings to include in their management report the name and registered office of the parent undertaking that is reporting sustainability information at group level, the weblinks to the consolidated management report of their parent undertaking and a reference in their management report to the fact that they are exempted from sustainability reporting. Member States should be able to require that the parent undertaking publish the consolidated management report in the languages they accept and that the parent undertaking provide any necessary translation in such languages. Such exemption should also apply where the parent undertaking reporting at group level is a third-country undertaking reporting sustainability information in accordance with equivalent sustainability reporting standards. Directive 2004/109/EC, as amended by this amending Directive, should provide for appropriate mechanisms to determine the equivalence of sustainability reporting standards, and undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union and undertakings whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union should be required to report in accordance with the same sustainability reporting standards. In this context, the implementing acts adopted by the Commission pursuant to point (i) of the first subparagraph of Article 23(4) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC establishing a mechanism for the determination of equivalence of standards should be used to determine whether to exempt subsidiary undertakings of third-country parent undertakings under the regime of Directive 2013/34/EU. Therefore, the subsidiary undertaking should be exempted when the consolidated sustainability reporting is carried out in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 29b of Directive 2013/34/EU introduced by this amending Directive or in a manner equivalent to those sustainability reporting standards, as determined in accordance with an implementing act on the equivalence of sustainability ( 17 ) Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 38).

It should be specified, however, that the exemption regime for consolidated financial statements and consolidated management reports operates independently from the exemption regime for consolidated sustainability reporting. An undertaking can therefore be exempted from consolidated financial reporting requirements but not from consolidated sustainability reporting requirements where its ultimate parent undertaking prepares consolidated financial statements and consolidated management reports in accordance with Union law, or in accordance with equivalent requirements if the undertaking is established in a third country, but does not carry out consolidated sustainability reporting in accordance with Union law, or in accordance with equivalent requirements if the undertaking is established in a third country.

(27) Credit institutions and insurance undertakings play a key role in the transition towards a fully sustainable and inclusive economic and financial system in line with the Green Deal. They can have significant positive and negative impacts via their lending, investment and underwriting activities. Credit institutions and insurance undertakings other than those that are required to comply with Directive 2013/34/EU, including cooperatives and mutual undertakings, should therefore be subject to sustainability reporting requirements, provided that they meet certain size criteria. Users of sustainability information would thus be enabled to assess both the impacts of such credit institutions and insurance undertakings on society and the environment and the risks arising from sustainability matters that such credit institutions and insurance undertakings could face. Directive 2013/34/EU provides for three possible criteria to determine whether an undertaking is to be considered a ‘large undertaking’, namely the balance sheet total, net turnover and the average number of employees during the financial year. The criterion of net turnover needs to be adapted for credit institutions and for insurance undertakings by referring to the definition of net turnover in Council Directives 86/635/EEC( 19 ) and 91/674/EEC( 20 ) instead of the general definition laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU.

Undertakings should also be required to disclose whether and how their business model and strategy take account of the interests of stakeholders; any opportunities for the undertaking arising from sustainability matters; the implementation of the aspects of the business strategy which affect, or are affected by, sustainability matters; any sustainability targets set by the undertaking and the progress made towards achieving them; the role of the board and management with regard to sustainability matters; the principal actual and potential adverse impacts connected with the undertaking’s activities; and how the undertaking has identified the information that it reports on.

Impacts connected with an undertaking’s activities include impacts directly caused by the undertaking, impacts to which the undertaking contributes, and impacts which are otherwise linked to the undertaking’s value chain. The due diligence process concerns the whole value chain of the undertaking including its own operations, its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chains. In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, an actual or potential adverse impact is to be considered a principal impact where it ranks among the greatest impacts connected with the undertaking’s activities based on: the gravity of the impact on people or the environment; the number of individuals that are or could be affected, or the scale of damage to the environment; and the ease with which the harm could be remediated, restoring the environment or affected people to their prior state.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1241, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "41f5e5a4-b40c-4ae7-ba4f-14107ce5a528", "page_content": "of damage to the environment; and the ease with which the harm could be remediated, restoring the environment or affected people to their prior state. (32) Directive 2013/34/EU does not require the disclosure of information on intangible resources other than intangible assets recognised in the balance sheet. It is widely recognised that information on intangible assets and other intangible factors, including internally generated intangible resources, is underreported, impeding the proper assessment of an undertaking’s development, performance and position, and the monitoring of investments. To enable investors to better understand the increasing gap between the accounting book value of many undertakings and their market valuation, which is observed in many sectors of the economy, adequate reporting on intangible resources should be required of all large undertakings and all undertakings, except micro-undertakings, whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union. Nonetheless, certain information on intangible resources is intrinsic to sustainability matters, and should therefore be part of sustainability reporting. For example, information about employees’ skills, competences, experience, loyalty to the undertaking and motivation for improving processes, goods and services, is sustainability information regarding social matters that could also be considered as information on intangible resources. Likewise, information about the quality of the relationships between the undertaking and its stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and communities affected by the activities of the undertaking, is sustainability information relevant to social or governance matters that could also be considered as information on intangible resources. Such examples illustrate how in some cases it is not possible to distinguish information on intangible resources from information on sustainability matters.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1945, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "add5f35b-fbbf-4e18-8e13-6470c9b62597", "page_content": "on intangible resources. Such examples illustrate how in some cases it is not possible to distinguish information on intangible resources from information on sustainability matters. (33) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU do not specify whether the information to be reported is to be forward-looking or information about past performance. There is currently a lack of forward-looking disclosures, which users of sustainability information especially value. Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should therefore specify that the sustainability information reported is to include forward-looking and retrospective information and both qualitative and quantitative information. Information should be based on conclusive scientific evidence where appropriate. Information should also be harmonized, comparable and based on uniform indicators where appropriate, while allowing for reporting that is specific to individual undertakings and does not endanger the commercial position of the undertaking. Reported sustainability information should also take into account short-, medium- and long-term time horizons and contain information about the undertaking’s whole value chain, including its own operations, its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chain, as appropriate. Information about the undertaking’s whole value chain would include information related to its value chain within the Union and information that covers third countries if the undertaking’s value chain extends outside the Union. For the first three years of the application of the measures to be adopted by the Member States in accordance with this amending Directive, in the event that not all the necessary information regarding the value chain is available, the undertaking should explain the efforts made to obtain the information about its value chain, the reasons why that information could not be obtained, and the plans of the undertaking to obtain such information in the future.

The different treatment of disclosures on the policies that undertakings may have, compared to the other reporting areas included in those Articles, has created confusion among reporting undertakings and has not helped to improve the quality of the reported information. Therefore, there is no need to maintain such different treatment of policies in that Directive. The sustainability reporting standards should determine what information needs to be disclosed in relation to each of the reporting areas mentioned in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU as amended by this amending Directive.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1023, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "8d62634f-8bbc-4be5-8b19-5c5b22117658", "page_content": "be disclosed in relation to each of the reporting areas mentioned in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU as amended by this amending Directive. (37) Undertakings that fall under the scope of Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU may rely on national, Union-based or international reporting frameworks, and where they do so, they have to specify which frameworks they have relied upon. However, Directive 2013/34/EU does not require undertakings to use a common reporting framework or standard, and it does not prevent undertakings from choosing not to use any reporting framework or standards at all. As required by Article 2 of Directive 2014/95/EU, on 5 July 2017, the Commission adopted a Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on non-financial reporting (methodology for reporting non-financial information)’ (‘Guidelines on non-financial reporting’), providing for non-binding guidelines for undertakings that fall under the scope of that Directive. On 17 June 2019, the Commission adopted its Guidelines on reporting climate-related information, containing additional guidelines, specifically on reporting climate-related information. Those Guidelines on reporting climate- related information explicitly incorporated the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Available evidence indicates that the Guidelines on non-financial reporting did not have a significant impact on the quality of non-financial reporting by undertakings under the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. The voluntary nature of the guidelines means that undertakings are free to decide whether to apply them or not. The guidelines can therefore not ensure on their own the comparability of the information disclosed by different undertakings, or the disclosure of all information that users of that information consider relevant. That is why there is a need for mandatory common sustainability reporting standards to ensure that information is comparable and that all relevant information is disclosed. Building on the double materiality principle, standards should cover all information that is material to users of that information. Common sustainability reporting standards are also necessary to enable the assurance and digitalisation of sustainability reporting and to facilitate its supervision and enforcement. The development of mandatory common sustainability reporting standards is necessary to reach a situation in which sustainability information has a status comparable to that of financial information. The adoption of sustainability reporting standards by means of delegated acts would ensure harmonised sustainability reporting across the Union.

In addition, mandatory sustainability reporting standards for Union undertakings should be commensurate with the level of ambition of the Green Deal and the Union’s objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as with the intermediate targets under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119.

(39) The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is a non-profit association established under Belgian law that serves the public interest by providing advice to the Commission on the endorsement of international financial reporting standards. EFRAG has established a reputation as a European centre of expertise on corporate reporting and is well placed to foster coordination between Union sustainability reporting standards and international initiatives that seek to develop standards that are consistent across the world. In March 2021, a multi- stakeholder task force set up by EFRAG published recommendations for the possible development of sustainability reporting standards for the Union. Those recommendations contain proposals to develop a coherent and comprehensive set of sustainability reporting standards, covering all sustainability matters from a double materiality perspective. Those recommendations also contain a detailed roadmap for developing such standards, and proposals for mutually reinforcing cooperation between global standard-setting initiatives and standard-setting initiatives of the Union. In March 2021, the EFRAG Board President published recommendations for possible governance changes to EFRAG in the event that it were to be asked to develop technical advice about sustainability reporting standards. The EFRAG Board President’s recommendations include the setting up of a new sustainability reporting pillar within EFRAG, while not significantly modifying the existing financial reporting pillar. In March 2022, the EFRAG General Assembly appointed the members of the newly created EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board. When adopting sustainability reporting standards, the Commission should take account of technical advice that EFRAG will develop. In order to ensure high-quality standards that contribute to the European public good and meet the needs of undertakings and of users of the information reported, EFRAG should have sufficient public funding to ensure its independence. Its technical advice should be developed with proper due process, public oversight and transparency, and based on the expertise of a balanced representation of relevant stakeholders, including undertakings, investors, civil society organisations and trade unions, and should be accompanied by cost-benefit analyses. Participation in EFRAG’s work at technical level should be conditional on expertise in sustainability reporting and should not be conditional on any financial contribution, without prejudice to the participation of public bodies and national standard-setting organisations in that work. A transparent process avoiding conflicts of interest should be guaranteed. To ensure that Union sustainability reporting standards take account of the views of the Member States, before adopting those standards the Commission should consult the Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/852, (the ‘Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance’) and the Accounting Regulatory Committee, referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 23 ), (the ‘Accounting Regulatory Committee’) in relation to EFRAG’s technical advice.

Union standards should take account of any sustainability reporting standards developed under the auspices of International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. To avoid unnecessary regulatory fragmentation that could have negative consequences for undertakings operating globally, Union sustainability reporting standards should contribute to the process of convergence of sustainability reporting standards at global level, by supporting the work of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

Regulation (EU) 2020/852 provides a classification of the environmental objectives of the Union. For reasons of coherence, it is appropriate to use a similar classification to identify the environmental factors that should be addressed by sustainability reporting standards. The sustainability reporting standards should consider and specify any geographical or other contextual information that undertakings should disclose to provide an understanding of their principal impacts on sustainability matters and the principal risks to the undertaking arising from sustainability matters.

Such information should cover the impacts of the undertaking on people, including workers, and on human health. The information that undertakings disclose about human rights should include information about forced labour and child labour in their value chains where relevant. Sustainability reporting requirements concerning forced labour should not free public authorities of their responsibility to address, through trade policy and diplomatic means, the import of goods produced as a result of human rights abuses, including forced labour. Undertakings should also be able to report on possible risks and trends regarding employment and incomes. Sustainability reporting standards that address social factors should specify the information that undertakings should disclose with regard to the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights that are relevant to businesses, including equal opportunities for all and working conditions. The Action Plan on the European Pillar of Social Rights, adopted by the Commission on 4 March 2021, calls for stronger requirements on undertakings to report on social issues. The sustainability reporting standards should also specify the information that undertakings should disclose with regard to the human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles and standards established in the International Bill of Human Rights and other core UN human rights conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN EN L 322/30 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2022", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 2094, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "675b6a21-4163-4100-bd3d-000a136a1a23", "page_content": "of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN EN L 322/30 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2022 Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the fundamental conventions of the ILO, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

(50) Users need information about governance factors. Governance factors that are most relevant to users are listed by authoritative reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, as well as by authoritative global frameworks such as the Global Governance Principles of the International Corporate Governance Network and the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. Sustainability reporting standards should specify the information that undertakings should disclose on governance factors. Such information should cover the role of an undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory bodies with regard to sustainability matters, the expertise and skills needed to fulfil that role or the access such bodies have to such expertise and skills, whether the company has a policy in terms of incentives which are offered to members of those bodies and which are linked to sustainability matters, and information on an undertaking’s internal control and risk management systems in relation to the sustainability reporting process. Users also need information about undertakings’ corporate culture and approach to business ethics, which are recognised elements of authoritative frameworks on corporate governance, such as the Global Governance Principles of the International Corporate Governance Network, including information about anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and about the undertaking’s activities and commitments aimed at exerting its political influence, including its lobbying activities. Information about the management of the undertaking and the quality of relationships with customers, suppliers and communities affected by the activities of the undertaking, helps users to understand an undertaking’s risks and impacts related to sustainability matters. Information about relationships with suppliers includes payment practices relating to the date or period for payment, the rate of interest for late payment or the compensation for recovery costs referred to in Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council( 31 ). Every year, thousands of businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’), suffer an administrative and financial burden because they are paid late, or not at all. Ultimately, late payments lead to insolvency and bankruptcy, with destructive effects on entire value chains. Increasing the amount of information about payment practices should empower other undertakings to identify prompt and reliable payers, detect unfair payment practices, access information about the businesses they trade with, and negotiate fairer payment terms.

(53) Undertakings in the same sector are often exposed to similar sustainability-related risks, and they often have similar impacts on society and the environment. Comparisons between undertakings in the same sector are especially valuable to investors and other users of sustainability information. Sustainability reporting standards should therefore specify both information that undertakings in all sectors should disclose and information that undertakings should disclose depending on their sector of activity. Sector-specific sustainability reporting standards are especially important in the case of sectors associated with high sustainability risks for or impacts on the environment, human rights and governance, including sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 32 ), and the relevant activities within those sectors. When adopting sector-specific sustainability reporting standards, the Commission should ensure the information specified by those sustainability reporting standards is proportionate to the scale of the risks and impacts related to sustainability matters specific to each sector, taking account of the fact that the risks and impacts of some sectors are higher than for others. The Commission should also take account of the fact that not all activities within such sectors are necessarily associated with high sustainability risks or impacts. For undertakings that operate in sectors particularly reliant on natural resources, sector-specific sustainability reporting standards would require the disclosure of nature-related impacts on and risks for biodiversity and ecosystems. Sustainability reporting standards should also take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain, especially from suppliers that are small or medium-sized undertakings and from suppliers in emerging markets and economies. Sustainability reporting standards should specify disclosures concerning value chains that are proportionate and relevant to the scale and complexity of the activities of the undertakings, and the capacities and characteristics of undertakings in value chains, especially those capacities and characteristics of undertakings that are not subject to the sustainability reporting requirements provided for in this amending Directive. Sustainability reporting standards should not specify disclosures that would require undertakings to obtain information from small and medium-sized undertakings in their value chain that exceeds the information to be disclosed in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards for small and medium-sized undertakings. This should be without prejudice to any Union requirements on undertakings to conduct a due diligence process.

(55) Directive 2013/34/EU does not require that undertakings provide their management reports in a digital format, which hinders the findability and usability of the reported information. Users of sustainability information increasingly expect such information to be findable, comparable and machine-readable in digital formats. Member States should be able to require that undertakings subject to the sustainability reporting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU make their management reports available on their websites, free of charge to the public. Digitalisation creates opportunities to exploit information more efficiently and holds the potential for significant cost savings for both users and undertakings. Digitalisation also enables the centralisation at Union and Member State level of data in an open and accessible format that facilitates reading and allows for the comparison of data. Undertakings should therefore be required to prepare their management report in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 ( 33 ), and to mark up their sustainability reporting, including the disclosures required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the electronic reporting format specified in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 once that is determined. A digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability reporting standards will be necessary to allow the reported information to be tagged in accordance with those sustainability reporting standards. These requirements should feed into the work on digitalisation announced by the Commission in its Communication of 19 February 2020 entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ and in its Communication of 24 September 2020 entitled ‘Digital Finance Strategy for the EU’. These requirements would also complement the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) for public corporate information as envisaged in the Commission’s Communication of 24 September 2020 entitled ‘A Capital Markets Union for people and businesses - new action plan’ in which the need to provide comparable information in a digital format is also considered.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 2370, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "387e32af-d64c-4b28-b765-649c85738baf", "page_content": "Markets Union for people and businesses - new action plan’ in which the need to provide comparable information in a digital format is also considered.

Member States are allowed to do so where the undertaking concerned prepares a separate report that is published together with the management report in accordance with Article 30 of that Directive, or where that report is made publicly available on the undertaking’s website within a reasonable period of time not exceeding 6 months after the balance sheet date, and is referred to in the management report. The same possibility exists for the consolidated non-financial statement referred to in Directive 2013/34/EU. Twenty Member States have used that option. The possibility of publishing a separate report hinders, however, the availability of information that connects financial information and information on sustainability matters.

(60) The assurance profession distinguishes between limited assurance engagements and reasonable assurance engagements. The conclusion of a limited assurance engagement is usually provided in a negative form of expression by stating that no matter has been identified by the practitioner to conclude that the subject matter is materially misstated. In a limited assurance engagement, the auditor performs fewer tests than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The amount of work for a limited assurance engagement is therefore less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The amount of work in a reasonable assurance engagement entails extensive procedures including consideration of internal controls of the reporting undertaking and substantive testing, and is therefore significantly greater than in a limited assurance engagement. The conclusion of a reasonable assurance engagement is usually provided in a positive form of expression and results in providing an opinion on the measurement of the subject matter against previously defined criteria. Directive 2013/34/EU requires Member States to ensure that the statutory auditor or audit firm checks whether the non- financial statement or the separate report has been provided. It does not require that an independent provider of assurance services verify the information, although it allows Member States to require such verification where they so wish. The absence of an assurance requirement concerning sustainability reporting, in contrast to the requirement for the statutory auditor to carry out statutory audits based on a reasonable assurance engagement, would threaten the credibility of the sustainability information disclosed, thus failing to meet the needs of the EN L 322/34 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2022", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1978, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "bc937217-8641-4351-8575-07e7e4e78be2", "page_content": "the credibility of the sustainability information disclosed, thus failing to meet the needs of the EN L 322/34 Official Journal of the European Union 16.12.2022 intended users of that information. Although the objective is to have a similar level of assurance for financial and sustainability reporting, the absence of a commonly agreed standard for the assurance of sustainability reporting creates the risk of different understandings and expectations of what a reasonable assurance engagement would consist of for different categories of sustainability information, especially with regard to forward-looking and qualitative disclosures. Therefore, a progressive approach to enhancing the level of the assurance required for sustainability information should be considered, starting with an obligation on the statutory auditor or audit firm to express an opinion about the compliance of the sustainability reporting with Union requirements based on a limited assurance engagement. That opinion should cover the compliance of the sustainability reporting with Union sustainability reporting standards, the process carried out by the undertaking to identify the information reported pursuant to the sustainability reporting standards and compliance with the requirement to mark up sustainability reporting. The auditor should also assess whether the undertaking’s reporting complies with the reporting requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. To ensure a common understanding and common expectations of what a reasonable assurance engagement would consist of, the statutory auditor or audit firm should be required to express an opinion based on a reasonable assurance engagement about the compliance of the sustainability reporting with Union requirements, when the Commission adopts assurance standards for reasonable assurance of sustainability reporting by means of delegated acts no later than 1 October 2028, following an assessment to determine if reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and undertakings. The gradual approach from limited assurance engagements to reasonable assurance engagements would also allow for the progressive development of the assurance market for sustainability information, and of undertakings’ reporting practices. Finally, such gradual approach would phase in the increase in costs for reporting undertakings, given that assurance of sustainability reporting based on a reasonable assurance engagement is more costly than assurance of sustainability reporting based on a limited assurance engagement. Undertakings subject to sustainability reporting requirements should be able to decide to have an assurance opinion on their sustainability reporting based on a reasonable assurance engagement if they so wish, and in such cases they should be deemed to have complied with the obligation to have an opinion based on a limited assurance engagement. The opinion based on a reasonable assurance engagement concerning forward-looking information is only an assurance that such information has been prepared in accordance with applicable standards.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 3101, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "0780c3fa-b2e9-4850-8ea8-089707689f4f", "page_content": "opinion based on a reasonable assurance engagement concerning forward-looking information is only an assurance that such information has been prepared in accordance with applicable standards. (61) Statutory auditors or audit firms already verify the financial statements and the management report. The assurance of sustainability reporting by the statutory auditors or audit firms would help to ensure the connectivity between, and consistency of, financial and sustainability information, which is particularly important for users of sustainability information. However, there is a risk of further concentration of the audit market, which could risk the independence of auditors and increase audit fees or fees relating to the assurance of sustainability reporting. Considering the key role of statutory auditors when providing assurance of sustainability reporting and ensuring reliable sustainability information, the Commission has announced that it will act to further enhance audit quality and to create a more open and diversified audit market, which are the conditions for the successful application of this amending Directive. In addition, it is desirable to offer undertakings a broader choice of independent assurance services providers for the assurance of sustainably reporting. Member States should therefore be allowed to accredit independent assurance services providers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council( 34 ) to provide an assurance opinion on sustainability reporting, which should be published together with the management report.

Furthermore, if they allow independent assurance services providers to carry out the assurance of sustainability reporting, Member States should also allow a statutory auditor, other than the one(s) carrying out the statutory audit of the financial statements, to express an assurance opinion on sustainability reporting. Member States should set out requirements that ensure the quality of the assurance of sustainability reporting carried out by independent assurance services providers and consistent outcomes in the assurance of sustainability reporting. Therefore, all independent assurance services providers should be subject to requirements that are equivalent to the requirements set out in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council( 35 ) as regards the assurance of sustainability reporting, while being adapted to the characteristics of independent assurance services providers which do not carry out statutory audits. In particular, Member States should set out equivalent requirements as regards training and examination, continuing education, quality assurance systems, professional ethics, independence, objectivity, confidentiality and professional secrecy, appointment and dismissal, the organisation of the work of independent assurance services providers, investigations and sanctions, and the reporting of irregularities. This would also guarantee a level playing field among all persons and firms allowed by Member States to provide an assurance opinion on sustainability reporting, including statutory auditors. If an undertaking seeks the opinion of an accredited independent assurance services provider other than the statutory auditor on its sustainability reporting, it should not in addition need to request an assurance opinion on its sustainability reporting from the statutory auditor.

As a consequence, national competent authorities of some Member States have no legal mandate to supervise those non-financial statements, especially where those non- financial statements are published in a separate report, outside of the annual financial report, which Member States may currently allow. It is therefore necessary to insert into Article 4(5) of Directive 2004/109/EC a reference to sustainability reporting. It is also necessary to require that the persons responsible within the issuer confirm in the annual financial report that, to the best of their knowledge, the management report is prepared in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards. In addition, given the novel character of the sustainability reporting requirements, ESMA should issue guidelines for national competent authorities to promote convergent supervision of sustainability reporting by issuers subject to Directive 2004/109/EC. Those guidelines should only apply to the supervision of undertakings whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union.", "source": "CELEX_32022L2464_EN_TXT.pdf", "page": 1, "type": "paragraph", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 1752, "parent_heading": "(Text with EEA relevance)", "sparse_vector": null, "dense_vector": null}, {"chunk_id": "bd99e500-90b1-46b1-8104-58beb422d51e", "page_content": "Directive 2004/109/EC.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making( 38 ).

The report on the implementation of this amending Directive should be published by 30 April 2029and every three years thereafter, and should be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals. By 31 December 2028, the Commission should review and report on the level of concentration of the sustainability assurance market. The review should take into account the national regimes applicable to independent assurance services providers and assess whether and to what extent such national regimes contribute to opening up the assurance market. By 31 December 2028, the Commission should assess possible legal measures to ensure sufficient diversification of the sustainability assurance market and appropriate sustainability reporting quality. The report on the level of concentration of the sustainability assurance market should be transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2028and be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals.
