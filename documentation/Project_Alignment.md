# Project Alignment Summary

## Alignment With Initial Idea
- Agentic assistant interprets regulations and translates them into ING-specific obligations.
- MCP-based tool orchestration provides traceability and interoperability.
- Interactive UI supports analyst workflows with embedding, retrieval, and evidence views.

## Gaps Against Stated Objectives
- Expert feedback surveys are not implemented yet (no capture or ingest loop).
- Analytics are limited to logs/status; no KPI dashboard or insight reporting.
- Internal API integration is minimal beyond MCP + retrieval.

## Beyond Requirements
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense + rerank) with evidence highlighting.
- UX improvements that separate embedding and generation, with clearer status.
- Traceability strengthened with decision logs and source-linked requirements.
